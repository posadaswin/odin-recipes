        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Picture a symphony of flavors and textures, lovingly layered into the quintessential Italian 
            comfort dish. Imagine wide, ruffled sheets of pasta, tender as satin, embracing rich, 
            slow-simmered ragù—a deep, aromatic blend of savory ground meat, sweet <em>San Marzano tomatoes</em>, 
            and a hint of garlic and herbs that has bubbled for hours until luxuriously thick. Between 
            these layers lies the heart of the dish: creamy béchamel sauce, delicately infused with nutmeg, 
            mingling with generous clouds of melted mozzarella and sharp, nutty <em>Parmigiano-Reggiano</em>. Each 
            forkful delivers a harmonious balance—the slight resistance of the pasta, the hearty richness 
            of the meat sauce, and the velvety, golden-cheese crust that crowns the top, baked until 
            gloriously bubbly and speckled with bronze.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not merely baked pasta; it is a culinary embrace, designed to delight the senses and comfort 
            the soul. The aroma alone—an intoxicating blend of toasted cheese, tomato, and basil—promises warmth 
            and satisfaction. Served steaming from the oven, its layers hold their form yet melt seamlessly in 
            the mouth, leaving a lingering richness that is both robust and refined. Perfect for gathering loved 
            ones around the table, lasagna is a celebration of patience and care, a dish that tastes like home, 
            no matter where you are.
